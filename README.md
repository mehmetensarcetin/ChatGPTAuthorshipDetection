# GPT-3.5 vs Human Text Classification Project

The Classification.py project aims to classify the texts generated by GPT-3.5 and compare them with human writing using machine learning methods. In this way, a model is created to determine whether a text is written by GPT-3.5 or by a human.

## Overview

In this project, various machine learning algorithms were utilized, such as:

- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

These models are combined with the **VotingClassifier** method to leverage the strengths of different algorithms, leading to improved classification performance. For text feature extraction, **TF-IDF** and **CountVectorizer** methods were employed. Additionally, **StandardScaler** is applied to normalize the features.

Commented-out code fragments show the development stages of the project, from its initial to its final form.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project was specifically created for the **Turkish language**. With the dataset used for training, the model achieved an accuracy rate of over **94%**. As the dataset size increased, the model's accuracy also improved significantly.

> **Note**: The dataset and front-end code are custom-built and therefore not included in this repository.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: A combination of Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM.
- **Voting Classifier**: Utilizes the strengths of multiple models to improve overall accuracy.
- **Text Feature Extraction**: Implements both TF-IDF and CountVectorizer for text representation.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a classification accuracy of over 94% for Turkish language texts.
- **Model Saving**: After training, users can choose to save the model for later use.
